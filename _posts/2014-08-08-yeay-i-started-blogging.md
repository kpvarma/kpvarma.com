I had always maintained a note book to keep track of 'Things to do', 'Code Snippets', 'New Keyboard Shortcuts', 'Commands' and other useful things. It always helped me to increase my productivity. I have been using [Evernote][evernote]{:target="_blank"} for some years now and I highly recommend it. I always wanted to blog but it never happened for some reason. I was waiting for myself to get some time so that I could design my own blog. Being a programmer, the pride in myself never allowed me to go with wordpress or blogger. Long story short, I never blogged for the past 10 years.

#### How did I start blogging ? ####

Early this year, I got a chance to volunteer the [gophercon.in][gophercon]{:target="_blank"} website work and had to try Jekyll. To be honest, I fell in love with [Jekyl][jekyll]{:target="_blank"}, I couldn't discover anything simpler to create a blog.

Meanwhile, I also happened to hear a talk on *taking the first step for a successful career* by `Amaresh Veer`, Director, [Qwinix Technologies][qwinix]{:target="_blank"}. His talk inspired me so much that I couldn't wait any further. I ended up creating a board in [Trello][trello]{:target="_blank"}, the same day for setting up [kpvarma.com][kpvarma]{:target="_blank"}. And... that's how **I started blogging**.

I though for a while on what my first post should be. I finally decided to write a blog post on how to setup a blog using [Jekyl][jekyll]{:target="_blank"} and [Github Pages][github-pages]{:target="_blank"}.

**I will soon update this post with a link to my first blog once its published. Stay Tuned!**

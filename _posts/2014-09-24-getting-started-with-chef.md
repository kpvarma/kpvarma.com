I though for a while on what my first post should be. I finally decided to write a blog post on how to setup a blog using [Jekyl][jekyll]{:target="_blank"} and [Github Pages][github-pages]{:target="_blank"}.

**I will soon update this post with a link to my first blog once its published. Stay Tuned!**

I had always maintained a note book to keep track of 'Things to do', 'Code Snippets', 'New Keyboard Shortcuts', 'Commands' and other useful things. It always helped me to boost my productivity. By the way, I use [Evernote][evernote]{:target="_blank"} and I highly recommend it. I always wanted to blog but I was hard on myself. I took a vow that I will blog only on an application rolled out by myself. i.e not on a wordpress or blogger.
I even designed the blog application in my mind and even tried devleoping it to an extend using Ruby on Rails. However it didn't finish and I didn't blog all these years :(

#### How did I start blogging ? ####

Thats when I got a chance to volunteer the [gophercon.in][gophercon]{:target="_blank"} website works and had to try Jekyll. I should say that I fell in love with [Jekyl][jekyll]{:target="_blank"}, I couldn't discover anything simpler to write a blog.

Meanwhile, I also happened to hear a talk on taking *the first step for a successful career* by `Amares Veer`, Director at [Qwinix][qwinix]{:target="_blank"}.
I couldn't wait, I ended up creating a board in [Trello][trello]{:target="_blank"}, the same day for setting up [kpvarma.com][kpvarma]{:target="_blank"}. **Yes I started blogging :)**.

But, What should be my first technical post? I thought about it and finally decided to write a blog post on how to setup a blog using [Jekyl][jekyll]{:target="_blank"} and [Github Pages][github-pages]{:target="_blank"}.

<br/>

#### What will you find in my blog ####

I would love to write about music, politics and society. However now I will stick to the technical thoughts

It was when I got a chance to work with our devops team here at Qwinix, I decided to gather my thoughts on Devops. I wanted to define What **Devops** is and why do we need it.

<br/>

### What is Devops? ###

There used to be a gap always, between the development team and the IT operations team ever since we started Software Engineering. Devops is a new trend reduce this gap thereby ensuring rapid production of services and products for organisations.

##### Development ######

A Development team consists of software engineers, designers, documentors, architects, engineering managers and other skilled guys to realise the application. A development team is responsible for the complete development of a working software right from gathering the requirements to the delivery of the application.

##### Quality Assurance #####

The Quality Assurance team usully consists of quality engineers, QA managers who closely work with Business Analysts to ensure the quality of the developed software.

##### Technology Operations #####

Development
Testing
App Configuration
Deployment
Monitoring
Scaling
Automating

DevOps can be visualised as the intersection of development (software engineering), technology operations and quality assurance (QA). Devops aims at delivery, release managent, quality, smooth shipping of features, security and maintanability of operational process. Source: [Wikipedia][wikipedia]{:target="_blank"}

Devops is the new way to look at the whole thing. It put together all the best practices to ensure the smooth running of development, testing and IT operations all under one roof. Devops has strong basein Agile and Lean Methodologies.

#### Why do we need Devops? ####

We at Qwinix, started implementing Agile practices and Lean Methodologies early 2013. We tried adopting the following principles of software development:

- Start Early : Start the development as soon as enough information is available.
- Continous Learning : Countinous Learning was inevitable as we had to update ourselves to develop complete but tested functionalities.

##### What are we solving with Devops #####

- Predictability
- Risk Management
- Quality Assurance
- Continous Delivery
- Continous Improvement
- Fear to deploy to production
- It works for me


##### Devops - A way of working? #####

We tends to wait for problems to happen or things to go wrong so that we could find a remedy.
Why can't we fail faster so that we could correct ourselves faster ? In a software development, we tends to continue working ...

### How to start practicing devops ###

If you are a sysadmin, learn a programming language. Go and mingle with your friends in development team and get an interest in development. Learn ruby so that you could try Chef or give a try on Python so that you could dive into puppet or checkout docker. Join Devops meetup group and eventually become a sysadmin developer.

If you are a developer, go and talk to your friends who are sys admins and other IT operation guys. Get an understanding of what they are doing. Talk to them and create an awareness of the new methodologies like Agile and Lean to measure predictability.
Start automating things and move away from manual works as far as possible. In order to achieve that, conduct workshops and meetups and talk about the importance of pairing up.
Teach them a programming language like ruby or python. Help them to gain confidence in coding and start contributing to your codebase.

If you are a manager, Hire devops guys. If you are hiring a sys admin make sure that he is willing to adopt the new devops way. Highlight the 'Devops' keyword when advertising an opening in communities or job portals. Encourage developers to mingle with your sys admins to pair up. Get Systems team involved in the development meeting and continous integration process. Delegate the deployment work to them to get started with Devops.

If you are a top executive, redefine the roles and organisational hierarchy so that there are no toads in well. Give your team a bigger picture of the problems faced by your organisation. There is no **Greatest IT skill** which will help you solve all your problems. You need all type of skills. Build teams around people who are multi disciplinary and you will yield remarkable results for sure. Devops is not an upgraded version of system/infrastruction administration. So dont give training on devops exclusively to your systems or infra team alone. Devops is a culture, you cannot apply it to a part of your team alone.

Once you reach a state where you dont have a development team or sys admin / infrastructure team / QA team but just **THE TEAM**, you will see tremendous improvement in business. You will start relying on the team rather than on the individuals. The team will be available for you than earlier. You will deliver softare faster to the market making your clients happier then ever. And the bonus would be that you will eventually get rid of wasteful administration, micro management and blame gaming.
